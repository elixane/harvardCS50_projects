When initially writing my get_model function, I just followed the structure used in the lecture, ie using a single convolutional layer with 32 filters. This worked well to set up a base for the code, but unfortunately the model had a very low accuracy rate (roughly 5%) and barely improved after each epoch. I therefore decided to add a second convolutional layer. This improved the accuracy significantly, but was still only getting to about 60%. It also took a long time for the model to train itself (roughly 3 minutes). I then added a third convolutional layer and started to experiminent with the size of the filters in each layer. I also added some hidden layers until I was satisfied with the accuracy and loss rates. 

Something I noticed is that the first change I made to the code (adding a second convolutional layer) improved the accuracy significantly, but changes after that only made a small difference each time. I also realised that changing the sizes of hidden layers made a much bigger difference than simply adding more hidden layers.
